# Superconductivity Experiment

This repository contains python scripts, wrapped in a PyQT4 gui, to run the superconductivity lab at Columbia University. It utilizes the open-source library PyVISA for interfacing with the GPIB devices used during measurement. 

For more information on the lab, see http://tesla.phys.columbia.edu:8080/eka/conductivity/Conductivity%20Experiment/.
